This tool is for educational and informational purposes only. The analysis provided is generated by an AI model and is not a substitute for professional medical advice, diagnosis, or treatment.

If you think you may have a medical emergency, call your local emergency number immediately.

‚ú® Features
AI-Powered Analysis: Utilizes Google's gemini-2.0-flash-lite model to interpret symptoms and suggest potential conditions.

Personalized Input: Considers the user's age and gender to provide a more tailored and relevant analysis.

Structured Results: Presents the analysis in a clean, tabbed format:

Given Symptoms

Possible Causes

Potential Cures (with disclaimers)

Precautions & Preventions

Expert Advice

Emergency Level Assessment: Assigns a color-coded emergency level (Low to Critical) to help users gauge urgency.

Query History: Automatically saves each analysis to a local history.json file for later review.

Modern UI: A sleek, dark-themed, and responsive user interface built with Tailwind CSS.

üõ†Ô∏è Tech Stack
Backend: Python, Flask

AI Model: Google Gemini (gemini-2.0-flash-lite) via the google-generativeai package

Frontend: HTML, Tailwind CSS, JavaScript

Dependencies: python-dotenv

‚öôÔ∏è Setup and Installation
Follow these steps to get the application running on your local machine.

1. Prerequisites
Python 3.8 or higher

pip (Python package installer)

A Google Gemini API Key. You can obtain one from Google AI Studio.

2. Clone the Repository
git clone [https://github.com/your-username/healthcare-symptom-checker.git](https://github.com/your-username/healthcare-symptom-checker.git)
cd healthcare-symptom-checker

3. Set Up a Virtual Environment
It's recommended to create a virtual environment to manage project dependencies.

On macOS/Linux:

python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate

On Windows:

python -m venv venv
.\venv\Scripts\activate

4. Install Dependencies
Install all the required Python packages from the requirements.txt file.

pip install -r requirements.txt

5. Configure Environment Variables
Create a file named .env in the root directory of the project. This file will store your API key securely.

GEMINI_API_KEY="YOUR_GEMINI_API_KEY_HERE"

Replace "YOUR_GEMINI_API_KEY_HERE" with your actual Gemini API key.

6. Run the Application
Start the Flask development server.

flask run

Or, you can run the Python script directly:

python app.py

The application should now be running at http://127.0.0.1:5000. Open this URL in your web browser.

üöÄ How It Works
User Input: The user enters their age, gender, and a detailed description of their symptoms on the web interface.

API Call: The Flask backend receives the data and constructs a detailed system prompt, which includes the user's information and specific instructions for the AI.

Gemini API: A request is sent to the Gemini API. The model analyzes the prompt and generates a structured response in Markdown format.

Response Parsing: The backend parses the Markdown response, extracting the content for each category (Symptoms, Causes, Cure, etc.).

History Logging: The user's query and the AI's parsed analysis are saved as a new entry in the history.json file with a timestamp.

Display Results: The parsed data is sent back to the frontend as a JSON object, where JavaScript dynamically populates the UI to display the analysis to the user.
