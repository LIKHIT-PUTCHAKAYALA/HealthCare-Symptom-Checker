            "possible_causes": "- **Muscle Strain:** This is a common cause of leg pain, especially in young, active males. It can be caused by overuse, sudden movements, or inadequate warm-up before exercise.\n- **Deep Vein Thrombosis (DVT):** While less common in younger individuals, DVT should be considered.
